## 📁 What's in this Archive

**Current Reality:**
- ✅ Portal Home Hub is live at portalhomehub.com
- ✅ All user flows (Agent, Landlord, FSBO) are working
- ✅ Payment system is operational
- ✅ Multi-country system (Jamaica + Guyana) is complete
- ✅ Admin dashboard is fully functional
- ✅ Database is populated and working
- ✅ Super admin security protections are in place
