# SESSION STATUS - October 29, 2025

## 🎯 COMPLETED TASKS

### ✅ Build Issues Fixed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved Vercel build error "Can't resolve '@/lib/supabase/server'"
- **Solution**: Removed overly aggressive `.vercelignore` that was excluding essential TypeScript files
- **Status**: Build now succeeds consistently (confirmed in deployment logs)
- **Current State**: Minimal `.vercelignore` keeps SQL files out but preserves all TypeScript client files

### ✅ UI/UX Improvements 
- **Updated Pricing Card**: Changed "Property Owner" → "Landlord Services"
- **Description Updated**: "Rent out your properties easily" → "Professional rental property management"
- **Reasoning**: More professional, clearer target audience identification
- **Status**: Live and deployed

### ✅ Database Cleanup API
- **Created**: `/api/cleanup-test-properties` endpoint for removing test properties
- **Features**: Preview (GET) and execute (POST) modes
- **Safety**: Comprehensive filtering to identify test/fake properties
- **Status**: Ready for use when needed
