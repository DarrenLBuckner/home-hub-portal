# üéØ QUICK RESUME GUIDE - Tomorrow's Session

## IMMEDIATE STATUS CHECK
When you return tomorrow, first verify these are still working:

### 1. Admin Login Test (2 minutes)
```
1. Go to: https://home-hub-portal-qj1mnfi4z-darren-lb-uckner-s-projects.vercel.app/admin-dashboard
2. Login as: mrdarrenbuckner@gmail.com (should see "Super Admin" indicator)
3. Login as: qumar@guyanahomehub.com (should see "Owner Admin - Guyana" indicator)
4. Check payment dashboard loads: /admin-payments
```

### 2. If Something Broke Overnight
```bash
# Quick fixes:
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

## TWO PATHS FORWARD

### üöÄ PATH A: Quick Payment Testing (15 min total)
**Goal**: See payment system working with sample data

**Steps**:
1. Open Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy/paste contents of `supabase/sample_payment_data.sql`
4. Run the SQL
5. Refresh admin-payments page
6. You should see FSBO, landlord, and agent payments

**Why This**: Fastest way to verify payment visibility across all user types

---

### üîß PATH B: Full Payment Integration (2-3 hours)
**Goal**: Connect registration to payment system

**Major Tasks**:
1. Update user registration endpoints to create payment_history records
2. Modify Stripe webhook to write to payment_history table
3. Test complete workflow: registration ‚Üí payment ‚Üí admin dashboard
4. Move admin config from hardcoded to database

**Why This**: Production-ready payment system with automatic record creation

---

## KEY FILES YOU'LL NEED

### For Quick Testing (Path A)
- `supabase/sample_payment_data.sql` ‚Üê Run this in Supabase
- Admin payments page: `/admin-payments` ‚Üê Check this after

### For Full Integration (Path B)
- `src/app/api/webhook/stripe/route.ts` ‚Üê Update payment recording
- Registration endpoints (need to find these) ‚Üê Add payment_history creation
- `src/app/admin-dashboard/page.tsx` ‚Üê Remove hardcoded config eventually
- `src/app/admin-payments/page.tsx` ‚Üê Remove hardcoded config eventually

## CURRENT ADMIN USERS
- **mrdarrenbuckner@gmail.com**: Super Admin (full access)
- **qumar@guyanahomehub.com**: Owner Admin (Guyana-focused)
- **To add more**: Update hardcoded config in both admin files

---

## IF YOU WANT TO ADD NEW ADMINS TOMORROW
1. Open `src/app/admin-dashboard/page.tsx`
2. Find `adminConfig` object (around line 125)
3. Add: `'newemail@example.com': { level: 'basic', country: 1 }`
4. Do same in `src/app/admin-payments/page.tsx`
5. Run `npm run build && vercel --prod`

## SESSION CONTEXT PRESERVED
All previous work and context has been saved in:
- `ADMIN_SESSION_CHECKPOINT_SEP27.md` (detailed technical log)
- `TEMPORARY_ADMIN_MANAGEMENT.md` (updated with today's progress)
- This file (quick resume guide)

**Bottom Line**: Admin system is fully operational. Payment system infrastructure ready. Your choice tomorrow: quick testing or full integration.
