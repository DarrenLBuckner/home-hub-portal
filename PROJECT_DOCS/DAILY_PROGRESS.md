## ✅ DAY 1 - ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS COMPLETE
**Date**: [Today's Date]  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Focus**: System Architecture & Technical Debt Analysis  

### 🎯 Completed Tasks:
- [x] **Complete Architecture Analysis**
  - Mapped data flow from Portal → Database → Guyana
  - Documented all API endpoints and their purposes
  - Identified property categorization system
  - Verified user role assignments (FSBO/Agent/Landlord)

- [x] **Property Data Flow Verification**
  - Traced property creation through Portal forms
  - Confirmed site_id filtering (site='guyana')
  - Validated listing_type flow ('sale'/'rent')
  - Tested proxy route configuration

- [x] **Feature/Amenity Alignment Check**
  - Documented Portal amenities storage (TEXT[] array)
  - Identified Guyana frontend filtering gaps
  - Found 16 amenity types in Portal vs 0 filters in Guyana
  - Confirmed property type mismatches

- [x] **Critical Issues Identification**
  - CRITICAL: Amenity filtering missing in Guyana
  - CRITICAL: Property type alignment needed
  - CRITICAL: CORS security too permissive
  - CRITICAL: No rate limiting on public API

- [x] **Project Documentation Creation**
  - Created PROJECT_DOCS/ folder structure
  - Written 30-day Launch Roadmap
  - Documented Technical Debt Registry
  - Completed Architecture Documentation
  - Set up Testing Checklist template

### 📊 Key Findings:
- **Architecture Status**: ✅ Functional but needs hardening
- **Critical Issues**: 4 must-fix items before launch
- **Total Technical Debt**: 15 items (4 critical, 6 important, 5 future)
- **Estimated Fix Time**: 39.5 development days total

### 🔍 Technical Details Discovered:
```typescript
// Portal API endpoint working correctly:
GET /api/public/properties?site=guyana&listing_type=rent

// Guyana proxy correctly filtering:
queryParams.set('site', 'guyana')

// ISSUE: Amenities stored but not filterable:
amenities: ["Pool", "Garage", "Security"] // In database
// No amenity filters in PropertyFilters.tsx
```

### 📈 Progress Metrics:
- **Documentation**: 100% complete
- **Analysis**: 100% complete  
- **Critical Path Planning**: 100% complete
- **Next Day Preparation**: 100% complete
