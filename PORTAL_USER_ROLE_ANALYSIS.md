## ANALYSIS STATUS
🔄 **IN PROGRESS:** Systematic testing of each role...

## 🚨 SECURITY ISSUES FOUND

### Issue #1: Inconsistent Permission Checking  
**File:** `/src/app/admin-dashboard/user-management/page.tsx`
**Problem:** Uses manual admin level checking instead of centralized permission system
**Risk:** May allow unauthorized access or bypass permission filters
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Issue #2: Weak Landlord Dashboard Access Control
**File:** `/src/app/dashboard/landlord/page.tsx` 
**Problem:** Non-landlords are not properly blocked - page loads with no error/redirect
**Risk:** Unauthorized users could see landlord dashboard layout 
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Added proper authorization check with admin override

### Issue #3: No Access Control on FSBO Dashboard
**File:** `/src/app/dashboard/fsbo/page.tsx`
**Problem:** No user_type checking - anyone can access FSBO dashboard
**Risk:** HIGH - Unauthorized access to FSBO features
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Added user_type validation with admin override

### Issue #4: No Access Control on Owner Dashboard  
**File:** `/src/app/dashboard/owner/page.tsx`
**Problem:** No user_type checking - anyone can access owner dashboard
**Risk:** HIGH - Unauthorized access to owner features  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Added user_type validation with admin override

**Previous Code:**
```tsx
if (profileError || !profile || (profile.admin_level !== 'super' && profile.admin_level !== 'owner')) {
```

**Fixed To:**
```tsx
const { adminData, permissions, isAdmin } = useAdminData();
if (!permissions?.canAccessUserManagement) {
```

### Issue #2: Super Admin Email Standardization
**Status:** ✅ FIXED (mrdarrenbuckner@gmail.com now consistent across all files)

---

## PERMISSION SYSTEM ANALYSIS

### ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY:
1. **System Settings Page** - Properly uses `canAccessSystemSettings`  
2. **Main Admin Dashboard** - Uses centralized `useAdminData` hook
3. **Property Review** - Applies country filtering correctly
4. **User Management Page** - NOW FIXED: Uses `canAccessUserManagement` permission
5. **Pricing Management** - Uses `canAccessPricingManagement` with country filtering  
6. **Diagnostic Page** - Uses `canAccessDiagnostics` (super admin only)

### ❌ NEEDS REVIEW:
- No remaining permission system issues found in admin dashboard pages

## 📊 USER DASHBOARD ANALYSIS

### ✅ SECURE DASHBOARDS:
1. **Agent Dashboard** - Proper `isAgent` check, shows limited content for non-agents
2. **Landlord Dashboard** - NOW SECURE: Proper authorization with admin override
3. **FSBO Dashboard** - NOW SECURE: user_type validation with admin override  
4. **Owner Dashboard** - NOW SECURE: user_type validation with admin override

### 🛡️ ADMIN OVERRIDE FEATURES:
All role-specific dashboards now allow access for:
- ✅ **Super Admins** (`admin_level: 'super'`) - Full access to all dashboards
- ✅ **Owner Admins** (`admin_level: 'owner'`) - Full access to all dashboards  
- ✅ **Regular Users** - Only access to their designated role dashboard

### 🔑 KEY SECURITY PRINCIPLES:

1. **Admin Hierarchy:**
   - Super Admin: Unrestricted access to everything
   - Owner Admin: Country-specific admin access + all user dashboards
   - Basic Admin: Limited to property approval/rejection only

2. **Role Separation:**  
   - Each user type can only access their designated dashboard
   - Admins can access all dashboards for oversight purposes
   - Cross-role property creation prevented for regular users

3. **Property Management:**
   - Users can only manage properties they created
   - Admins can override/delete any property (fraud prevention)
   - Country filtering applies to Owner Admins

4. **Security Override:**
   - Super Admins can take down spam/fraudulent properties
   - Owner Admins can handle stolen credit card situations
   - Regular users cannot bypass role restrictions
