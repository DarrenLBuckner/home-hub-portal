## üìã SECTION 3: VERIFY EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY (10 minutes)

**CRITICAL TEST**: Ensure nothing broke

**STEPS**:
1. **Test FSBO Flow**:
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000/register/fsbo`
   - Fill out form, proceed to payment

## üìã SECTION 4: TEST NEW FEATURES (10 minutes)

**VERIFY ENTERPRISE FEATURES**:

1. **Price Management**:
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   SELECT plan_name, price/100.0 as price_dollars FROM pricing_plans;
   ```
   Should show: Agent, FSBO, Landlord plans with prices

2. **Revenue Tracking**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM admin_revenue_dashboard LIMIT 5;
   ```
   Should run without errors (may be empty)

3. **Property Views**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public_main_properties;
   ```
   Should return number of active properties

**SUCCESS**: ‚úÖ All queries work, data appears
**FAILURE**: ‚ùå Note which query failed

---

## üö® EMERGENCY ROLLBACK (If needed)

**IF SOMETHING BREAKS**:

1. **Remove payment tables**:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS property_payments CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_subscriptions CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pricing_plans CASCADE;
   ```

2. **Remove admin interface**:
   ```bash
   rm src/app/admin-dashboard/pricing/page.tsx
   ```

3. **Restart development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## üìä FINAL VERIFICATION

**RUN THESE TESTS AFTER COMPLETION**:

### Database Health Check
```sql
-- Should return 3
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('pricing_plans', 'user_subscriptions', 'property_payments');
```

### Pricing System Check  
```sql
-- Should return multiple plans
SELECT plan_name, user_type, is_active FROM pricing_plans WHERE is_active = true;
```

### Frontend Integration Check
```sql
-- Should return property data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public_main_properties;
```

### Admin Interface Check
- Visit: `http://localhost:3000/admin-dashboard`
- Click "üí∞ Pricing" 
- Should see pricing management interface
