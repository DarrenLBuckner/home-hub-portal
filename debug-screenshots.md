# Admin Dashboard Debug Screenshots - UPDATED

Upload your NEW screenshots here to debug the button visibility issue.

## CURRENT STATUS:
- ✅ Fixed profiles join issue (changed from `!inner` to LEFT join)
- ✅ Added email notification system
- ❌ **STILL ISSUE**: Properties may not be showing with buttons

## What We Need to See:

### 1. Browser Console Screenshot:
- Open admin dashboard: `https://portalhomehub.com/admin-dashboard`
- Press F12 → Console tab
- Look for these debug messages:
  ```
  Loading dashboard data...
  Pending properties query result: [...]
  Rendering properties section. pendingProperties: [...]
  ```

### 2. Admin Dashboard Screenshot:
- Full page showing stats vs. display area
- Look for "Debug: pendingProperties = ..." text at bottom

### 3. What the Debug Should Tell Us:
- **If `pendingProperties` is empty `[]`**: Database query issue
- **If `pendingProperties` has data**: Rendering issue
- **If errors in console**: Specific technical problem

## Save Screenshots To:
`/mnt/c/LocalFiles/guyana-home-hub-portal/screenshots/`

## Next Steps After Screenshots:
1. If properties load → buttons should be visible
2. If properties don't load → database/RLS issue  
3. If properties load but no buttons → rendering issue

**The debug output will tell us exactly where the problem is!**
