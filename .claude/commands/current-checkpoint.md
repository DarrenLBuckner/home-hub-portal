# GUYANA HOME HUB PORTAL - STATUS SYSTEM MODERNIZATION CHECKPOINT
**Date**: September 22, 2025  
**Session**: Property Status System Overhaul + Agent Dashboard Enhancement  
**Status**: 🎯 ENTERPRISE STATUS SYSTEM OPERATIONAL

---

## 🚀 CURRENT STATE - STATUS SYSTEM COMPLETELY OVERHAULED

**✅ MAJOR SYSTEMS UPDATED:**
- ✅ Enterprise property status system implemented (Zillow-style consumer semantics)
- ✅ All dashboards updated: Admin, Landlord, FSBO, Agent
- ✅ Database constraints updated for new status values
- ✅ Agent dashboard enhanced with dual property type support
- ✅ Logout system fixed with aggressive session clearing
- ✅ Commission references removed (subscription-focused messaging)

**🛠️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE IMPROVED:**
- Status flow: `off_market` → `available` → `pending` → `sold`/`rented`
- Consumer-centric labels: LIVE, UNDER CONTRACT, SOLD, RENTED, PENDING APPROVAL
- Role-based property management: Admin approves, Users manage lifecycle
- Security: All status updates include user ID validation

---

## 📊 STATUS SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

### **New Status Values:**
```
- off_market: Properties pending admin approval
- available: Live properties visible to consumers  
- pending: Properties under contract/negotiation
- sold: Completed sales (FSBO/Agent sales)
- rented: Completed rentals (Landlord properties)
```

### **Updated Components:**
1. **Admin Dashboard** (`src/app/admin-dashboard/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Admin only approves properties (off_market → available)
   - ✅ Removed lifecycle management (no longer manages sold/rented)
   - ✅ Focuses on approval workflow only

2. **Landlord Dashboard** (`src/app/dashboard/landlord/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Status management: available → pending → rented
   - ✅ Property status buttons with security checks
   - ✅ Active listings count uses 'available' status

3. **FSBO Dashboard** (`src/app/dashboard/fsbo/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Status management: available → pending → sold
   - ✅ Card-based layout with status management
   - ✅ Fixed activeListings to use 'available' instead of 'approved'

4. **Agent Dashboard** (`src/app/dashboard/agent/`)
   - ✅ PropertyList.tsx: Dual status management (sales + rentals)
   - ✅ Intelligent buttons: "Mark Sold" vs "Mark Rented" based on listing_type
   - ✅ MyPropertiesTab.tsx: Fixed hardcoded property ID, added selection workflow
   - ✅ AgentDashboardWelcome.tsx: Removed commission references

### **Database Updates:**
- ✅ Status constraints updated via SQL commands
- ✅ All existing data converted to new status values
- ✅ Public API (`/api/public/properties/route.ts`) shows only 'available' properties
